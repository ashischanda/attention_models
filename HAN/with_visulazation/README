# I run the HAN network on medical_notes successfully. (main.py)
# The problem was that I don't know how to see the weight of the word?

# I loaded code (labels) in code_dict
# I loaded voca  in voca_dict
# I read raw_note_data from a dict 
# I run tokenize to make sentences from the raw_note_data


# makeRawNotedata.py is used for this

# Go at the link to see how to run visulaization code
